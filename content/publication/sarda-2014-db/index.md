abstract: "Forty-four shore-normal transects along the Northwestern Mediterranean coast between the mouth of the Rhône River (France) and Valencia City (Spain) were sampled during the REDIT-I (September 1998, [R1]) and REDIT-II (December 1999, [R2]) campaigns. Polychaete distribution patterns on shallow littoral fine sands (10 to 50 m water depths) were analyzed at a regional scale. A total of 359 species of polychaetes were identified which represents 38% of all polychaete species recorded in the western Mediterranean. Four main soft-bottom communities were identified from the samples in the area: Littoral Fine Sands, Littoral Sandy Mud, Terrigenous Coastal Mud and Detritic Sand. Predominantly sandy environments were characterized by _Ditrupa arietina_ and _Owenia fusiformis_ while _Lumbrineris latreilli_, _Hilbigneris gracilis_ and _Sternaspis scutata_ were numerically dominant in muddy environments. Biological diversity assessments at different temporal and spatial scales are required by the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC) in accordance with criteria and methodological standards of Good Environmental Status (GEnS). Selected indicators for descriptors are explored based on this mesoscale assessment."
