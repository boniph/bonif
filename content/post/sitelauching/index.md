## Hi, all.
<br>
This is my first website for communications about recent scientific discoveries and publications; and to propose my expertise in polychaetes to youas consultant.

Also, I expect it to be a place to meet people and make interesting discussions.  
Please, feel free to give your thoughts and increase the quality of our discussions :D  


Thank you for being here,  
Polo
