Both genera belong to the Prionospio complex, whose members are known to have limited distinguishing characters. Morphological identification of specimens from the deep sea is challenging, as fragmentation and other damages are common during sampling. These issues impede investigations into the distribution patterns of these genera in the deep sea. In this study, we employ two molecular markers (16S rRNA and 18S) to study the diversity and the distribution patterns of _Prionospio_ and _Aurospio_ from the tropical North Atlantic, the Puerto Rico Trench and the central Pacific. Based on different molecular analyses (Automated Barcode Gap Discovery, GMYC, pairwise genetic distances, phylogenetics, haplotype networks), we were able to identify and differentiate 21 lineages (three lineages composed solely of GenBank entries) that represent putative species. Seven of these lineages exhibited pan-oceanic distributions (occurring in the Atlantic as well as the Pacific) in some cases even sharing identical 16S rRNA haplotypes in both oceans. Even the lineages found to be restricted to one of the oceans were distributed over large regional scales as for example across the Mid-Atlantic Ridge from the Caribbean to the eastern Atlantic ( 3389 km). Our results suggest that members of _Prionospio_ and _Aurospio_ may have the potential to disperse across large geographic distances, largely unaffected by topographic barriers and possibly even between oceans. Their high dispersal capacities are probably explained by their free-swimming long-lived planktonic larvae.","tags":["Biodiversity","Vema Fracture","Atlantic"],"title":"High diversity and pan-oceanic distribution of deep-sea polychaetes: Prionospio and Aurospio (Annelida: Spionidae) in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Craig R Smith","Travis Washburn","Lénaïck Menot","Paulo Bonifácio","Ellen Pape","Lupita Bribiesca-Contreras","Thomas Dahlgren","Tomohiko Fukushima","Adrian Glover","Se Jon Ju","Ok Hwan Yu"],"categories":["Ecology","Deep-sea"],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"b4f4ade5e3bbaac23093ac3a0c25d4d6","permalink":"/publication/smith-uk/","publishdate":"2020-04-24T10:18:33+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/smith-uk/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Biodiversity","CCFZ","Pacific","Mining"],"title":"SEDIMENT MACROFAUNA – A synthesis of sediment macrofaunal biodiversity in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paulo Bonifácio","Antoine Grémare","Jean-Michel Amouroux","Céline Labrune"],"categories":["Ecology","Coast"],"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"b692fb90785488bcd60c3600ac3f21ce","permalink":"/publication/bonifacio-2019-ce/","publishdate":"2020-04-24T10:18:33+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bonifacio-2019-ce/","section":"publication","summary":"Marine ecosystems worldwide are affected by both natural variation and human activities; to disentangle and understand their individual role in influencing the macrobenthic community composition is challenging. The relationship between interannual variability in atmospheric circulation, dictated by the climatic oscillation indices, and the benthic macrofauna composition was assessed at four sampling sites located in the Bay of Banyuls‐sur‐Mer (NW Mediterranean Sea). Between 2004 and 2013, these sites were sampled annually during autumn/winter and analyzed for sediment grain‐size and benthic macrofauna composition (species richness, abundance, and biomass). Temporal changes in these descriptors were correlated with two climatic indices (NAO and WeMO indices) and a set of environmental parameters integrated over three different time periods (i.e., whole year, springtime, and wintertime). Our results confirm the occurrence of major temporal changes in the composition of macrobenthic communities within the Gulf of Lions. More specifically, the results indicate that (a) the WeMO appears to be more closely related to benthic macrofauna composition in the Bay of Banyuls‐sur‐Mer than the NAO, (b) winter is a better integration period than spring or the whole year as a proxy for community composition changes, and (c) Rhône River water flow is likely involved in the control of benthic macrofauna composition in the whole Gulf of Lions. The present study highlights the importance of WeMO as a regional proxy, which can be used to evaluate changes in benthic macrofauna linked to climatic variability.","tags":["Biodiversity","Mediterranean Sea","Thesis"],"title":"Climate-driven changes in macrobenthic communities in the Mediterranean Sea: A 10-year study in the Bay of Banyuls-sur-Mer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c9b5771543b03b8149b612b630936a56","permalink":"/experience/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/experience/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Experience and scientific formations","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"/research/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Research Interest","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Paulo Bonifácio","Lénaïck Menot"],"categories":["Systematics","Deep-sea","Taxonomy"],"content":"  R\n","date":1542153600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542153600,"objectID":"29ef2c89b83b5ded9be5e1b9e07f7154","permalink":"/publication/bonifacio-2018-ed/","publishdate":"2020-04-24T10:18:33+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bonifacio-2018-ed/","section":"publication","summary":"This is the first study within the CCFZ describing polynoids species (17 new species and four new genera).

Results show that the 3 main benthic communities identified in 1998 were still present in 2010 although their composition changed. Using only year and station of sampling we found a significant space-time interaction explaining changes in macrofaunal community composition, and, in this study, stations differ primarily in terms of depth and distance to the Rhône river mouth. Temporal changes in benthic macrofauna composition were clearly most important at shallow stations (i.e., in the Littoral Fine Sand community) than at deep ones (i.e., Terrigenous Coastal Mud community). These results are in good agreement with the current paradigm according to which climatic oscillations such as NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) and WeMO (Western Mediterranean Oscillation) are indirectly (i.e., through changes in the frequency of occurrence and the intensity of storms) controlling benthic macrofauna composition in the Gulf of Lions. This hypothesis is further supported by a meta-analysis of changes in the average and maximal yearly abundances of the polychaete Ditrupa arietina. At last, the spatial modelling of 1998 and 2010 benthic macrofauna compositions both suggested a significant effect of Rhône River inputs on the spatial distribution of benthic macrofauna in the Gulf of Lions.","tags":["Biodiversity","Rhône","Mediterranean Sea","Climate change","Thesis"],"title":"Long-term (1998 vs. 2010) large-scale comparison of soft-bottom benthic macrofauna composition in the Gulf of Lions, NW Mediterranean Sea","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bart De Smet","Ellen Pape","Torben Riehl","Paulo Bonifácio","Liesbet Colson","Ann Vanreusel"],"categories":["Ecology","Deep-sea"],"content":"","date":1491868800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491868800,"objectID":"b20e944f3b29480cd0d1682715425f01","permalink":"/publication/de-smet-2017/","publishdate":"2020-04-24T10:18:33+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/de-smet-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep-sea areas characterized by the presence of polymetallic nodules are getting increased attention due to their potential commercial and strategic interest for metals such as nickel, copper, and cobalt. The polymetallic nodules occur in areas beyond national jurisdiction, regulated by the International Seabed Authority (ISA). Under exploration contracts, contractors have the obligation to determine the environmental baseline in the exploration areas. Despite a large number of scientific cruises to the central east Pacific Ocean, few published data on the macrofaunal biodiversity and community structure are available for the abyssal fields of the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCFZ). This study focused on the macrofaunal abundance, diversity, and community structure in three physically comparable, mineable sites located in the license area of Global Sea Mineral Resources N.V. (GSR), at ~4,500 m depth. A homogeneous but diverse macrofaunal community associated with the sediment from polymetallic nodule areas was observed at a scale of 10 to 100 s of km. However, slight differences in the abundance and diversity of Polychaeta between sites can be explained by a decline in the estimated flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) along a southeast-northwest gradient, as well as by small differences in sediment characteristics and nodule abundance. The observed homogeneity in the macrofaunal community is an important prerequisite for assigning areas for impact and preservation reference zones. However, a precautionary approach regarding mining activities is recommended, awaiting further research during the exploration phase on environmental factors structuring macrofaunal communities in the CCFZ. For instance, future studies should consider habitat heterogeneity, which was previously shown to structure macrofauna communities at larger spatial scales. Acknowledging the limited sampling in the current study, a large fraction (59–85%; depending on the richness estimator used and the macrofaunal taxon of interest) of the macrofaunal genus/species diversity from the habitat under study was characterized.","tags":["Biodiversity","CCFZ","Pacific","Mining"],"title":"The Community Structure of Deep-Sea Macrofauna Associated with Polymetallic Nodules in the Eastern Part of the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Glover","Thomas Dahlgren","Sergio Taboada","Gordon Paterson","Helena Wiklund","Andrea Waeschenbach","Amber Cobley","Pedro Martı́nez","Stefanie Kaiser","Sarah Schnurr","Sahar Khodami","Uwe Raschka","Daniel Kersken","Heiko Stuckas","Lénaı̈ck Menot","Paulo Bonifácio","Ann Vanreusel","Lara Macheriotou","Marina Cunha","Ana Hilario","Clara Rodrigues","Ana Colaço","Pedro Ribeiro","Magdalena Błażewicz","Andrew Gooday","Daniel Jones","David Billett","Aurélie Goineau","Diva Amon","Craig Smith","Tasnim Patel","Kirsty McQuaid","Ralph Spickermann","Stefan Brager"],"categories":["Ecology","Deep-sea"],"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"8df4998532ddd6bf7994c6ebfb9a206a","permalink":"/publication/glover-2016-ey/","publishdate":"2020-04-24T10:18:33+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/glover-2016-ey/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent years have seen a rapid increase in survey and sampling expeditions to the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) abyssal plain, a vast area of the central Pacific that is currently being actively explored for deep-sea minerals (ISA, 2016).

Bulk characteristics of sedimentary organics presented decreasing inshore/offshore gradients during both April 2007 and July 2011 but not during May and December 2008. There were significant temporal changes in EHAA/THAA at all stations. Changes in benthic macrofauna composition differed between: (1) the delta front and the prodelta, and (2) the distal zone. In the former area, the dry period was associated with establishing a mature community characterized by high abundances and species richness.
