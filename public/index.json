This family contains approximately 900 species within 18 subfamilies, some of them restricted to the deep sea, such as Macellicephalinae which is the most diverse among the deep-sea subfamilies. In the abyssal Equatorial Pacific Ocean, the biodiversity of benthic communities is at stake in the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCFZ) due to increased industrial interest for polymetallic nodules. Actually, the CCFZ harbors the largest fields of manganese nodules with a minimum sale value of 25,000 billion US Dollars. Unfortunately, the biodiversity records of invertebrates in this region are scarce; but the data gathered during the JPI Oceans cruise SO239 significantly contributed to fill this gap with five different areas sampled between 4000-5000 m depth (Eastern CCFZ).\nA large collection of deep-sea polynoids collected during the cruise led to the discovery of about 80 molecular operational taxonomic units (or potential species) and, for the first time ever, allowed us to provide insights into the evolution of this poorly understood group. Among these potential species, 17 new species and four new genera have been described. This highlights the high diversity hidden at abyssal depth.\n We still know very little about the worms living in the CCFZ. In every sample taken from the abyss, we found new species. We need funds/time/people to describe them before is too late!\n Furthermore, I drew inspiration naming species from geek culture, such as: Abyssarya acus named after Arya Stark from the novel “A song of ice and fire” (TV series Game of Thrones) by George R. R. Martin; Hodor hodor named after another character from the same book; or yet, Yodanoe desbruyeresi dedicated to the Grand Master of the Jedi Order, Yoda, in the Star Wars saga. Please, click on the pictures below for detail.\n         The head shape of polynoids in shallow waters commonly presents two lateral antennae and one median antenna. The presence of these antennae is an important character helping the classification of the subfamilies. Based on molecular and morphological phylogenetic analyses, we observed that the subfamilies without lateral antennae composed a homogeneous group within the polynoids from both shallow and deep-sea. Interestingly, the subfamilies without median antenna also composed a group inside, so-called Anantennata. In order to create a homogeneous clade determined by the absence of lateral antennae and facilitate the identification of the subfamily, we have synonymized ten subfamilies with Macellicephalinae, the first-named subfamily.\n  Common head shape of polynoids   Currently (May 2020), the number of valid species beloging to Macellicephalinae is 116.\nThere is so much more out there :P\nMoreover, Polynoids are just one among the 42 families of polychaetes found in the CCFZ and threatened by nodules mining operations which are about to start. We need to study them before is too late.\nThis research received funding from the JPI Oceans pilot action \u0026lsquo;Ecological Aspects of Deep-Sea Mining\u0026rsquo;, the European Union Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007–2013) under the MIDAS project and REMIMA.\nReference: Bonifácio, P., \u0026amp; Menot, L.

Both genera belong to the Prionospio complex, whose members are known to have limited distinguishing characters. Morphological identification of specimens from the deep sea is challenging, as fragmentation and other damages are common during sampling. These issues impede investigations into the distribution patterns of these genera in the deep sea. In this study, we employ two molecular markers (16S rRNA and 18S) to study the diversity and the distribution patterns of _Prionospio_ and _Aurospio_ from the tropical North Atlantic, the Puerto Rico Trench and the central Pacific. Based on different molecular analyses (Automated Barcode Gap Discovery, GMYC, pairwise genetic distances, phylogenetics, haplotype networks), we were able to identify and differentiate 21 lineages (three lineages composed solely of GenBank entries) that represent putative species. Seven of these lineages exhibited pan-oceanic distributions (occurring in the Atlantic as well as the Pacific) in some cases even sharing identical 16S rRNA haplotypes in both oceans. Even the lineages found to be restricted to one of the oceans were distributed over large regional scales as for example across the Mid-Atlantic Ridge from the Caribbean to the eastern Atlantic ( 3389 km). Our results suggest that members of _Prionospio_ and _Aurospio_ may have the potential to disperse across large geographic distances, largely unaffected by topographic barriers and possibly even between oceans. Their high dispersal capacities are probably explained by their free-swimming long-lived planktonic larvae.","tags":["Biodiversity","Vema Fracture","Atlantic"],"title":"High diversity and pan-oceanic distribution of deep-sea polychaetes: Prionospio and Aurospio (Annelida: Spionidae) in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Craig R Smith","Travis Washburn","Lénaïck Menot","Paulo Bonifácio","Ellen Pape","Lupita Bribiesca-Contreras","Thomas Dahlgren","Tomohiko Fukushima","Adrian Glover","Se Jon Ju","Ok Hwan Yu"],"categories":["Ecology","Deep-sea"],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"a81aa6bbe44dd23a4c83a623be501057","permalink":"https://bonif.io/publication/2020/smith-2020-uk/","publishdate":"2020-04-24T10:18:33+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020/smith-2020-uk/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Biodiversity","CCFZ","Pacific","Mining"],"title":"SEDIMENT MACROFAUNA – A synthesis of sediment macrofaunal biodiversity in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paulo Bonifácio","Antoine Grémare","Jean-Michel Amouroux","Céline Labrune"],"categories":["Ecology","Coast"],"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"342c713a867a3079673f7ec53593b5be","permalink":"https://bonif.io/publication/2019/bonifacio-2019-ibis/","publishdate":"2020-04-24T10:18:33+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2019/bonifacio-2019-ibis/","section":"publication","summary":"Marine ecosystems worldwide are affected by both natural variation and human activities; to disentangle and understand their individual role in influencing the macrobenthic community composition is challenging. The relationship between interannual variability in atmospheric circulation, dictated by the climatic oscillation indices, and the benthic macrofauna composition was assessed at four sampling sites located in the Bay of Banyuls‐sur‐Mer (NW Mediterranean Sea). Between 2004 and 2013, these sites were sampled annually during autumn/winter and analyzed for sediment grain‐size and benthic macrofauna composition (species richness, abundance, and biomass). Temporal changes in these descriptors were correlated with two climatic indices (NAO and WeMO indices) and a set of environmental parameters integrated over three different time periods (i.e., whole year, springtime, and wintertime). Our results confirm the occurrence of major temporal changes in the composition of macrobenthic communities within the Gulf of Lions. More specifically, the results indicate that (a) the WeMO appears to be more closely related to benthic macrofauna composition in the Bay of Banyuls‐sur‐Mer than the NAO, (b) winter is a better integration period than spring or the whole year as a proxy for community composition changes, and (c) Rhône River water flow is likely involved in the control of benthic macrofauna composition in the whole Gulf of Lions. The present study highlights the importance of WeMO as a regional proxy, which can be used to evaluate changes in benthic macrofauna linked to climatic variability.","tags":["Biodiversity","Mediterranean","Thesis","Climate"],"title":"Climate-driven changes in macrobenthic communities in the Mediterranean Sea: A 10-year study in the Bay of Banyuls-sur-Mer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vasily I Radashevsky","Victoria V Pankova","Vasily V Malyar","Tatyana V Neretina","Robin S Wilson","Tim M Worfold","María E Diez","Leslie H Harris","Stephane Hourdez","Céline Labrune","Céline Houbin","Britta Kind","Ralph Kuhlenkamp","Arne Nygren","Paulo Bonifácio","Guy Bachelet"],"categories":["Ecology","Coast"],"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"ff13cc1aa1141a95b415d7b0b60b91e3","permalink":"https://bonif.io/publication/2019/radashevsky-2019-jy/","publishdate":"2020-04-28T19:37:53.81195Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019/radashevsky-2019-jy/","section":"publication","summary":"The spionid polychaete _Boccardia proboscidea_ Hartman, 1940 is a tube-dweller and shell/stone-borer widely occurring in temperate waters across the world and considered invasive in many areas.

Using only year and station of sampling we found a significant space-time interaction explaining changes in macrofaunal community composition, and, in this study, stations differ primarily in terms of depth and distance to the Rhône river mouth. Temporal changes in benthic macrofauna composition were clearly most important at shallow stations (i.e., in the Littoral Fine Sand community) than at deep ones (i.e., Terrigenous Coastal Mud community). These results are in good agreement with the current paradigm according to which climatic oscillations such as NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) and WeMO (Western Mediterranean Oscillation) are indirectly (i.e., through changes in the frequency of occurrence and the intensity of storms) controlling benthic macrofauna composition in the Gulf of Lions.

The polymetallic nodules occur in areas beyond national jurisdiction, regulated by the International Seabed Authority (ISA). Under exploration contracts, contractors have the obligation to determine the environmental baseline in the exploration areas. Despite a large number of scientific cruises to the central east Pacific Ocean, few published data on the macrofaunal biodiversity and community structure are available for the abyssal fields of the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCFZ). This study focused on the macrofaunal abundance, diversity, and community structure in three physically comparable, mineable sites located in the license area of Global Sea Mineral Resources N.V. (GSR), at ~4,500 m depth. A homogeneous but diverse macrofaunal community associated with the sediment from polymetallic nodule areas was observed at a scale of 10 to 100 s of km. However, slight differences in the abundance and diversity of Polychaeta between sites can be explained by a decline in the estimated flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) along a southeast-northwest gradient, as well as by small differences in sediment characteristics and nodule abundance. The observed homogeneity in the macrofaunal community is an important prerequisite for assigning areas for impact and preservation reference zones. However, a precautionary approach regarding mining activities is recommended, awaiting further research during the exploration phase on environmental factors structuring macrofaunal communities in the CCFZ. For instance, future studies should consider habitat heterogeneity, which was previously shown to structure macrofauna communities at larger spatial scales. Acknowledging the limited sampling in the current study, a large fraction (59–85%; depending on the richness estimator used and the macrofaunal taxon of interest) of the macrofaunal genus/species diversity from the habitat under study was characterized.","tags":["Biodiversity","CCFZ","Pacific","Mining"],"title":"The Community Structure of Deep-Sea Macrofauna Associated with Polymetallic Nodules in the Eastern Part of the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vincent Le Garrec","Jacques Grall","Claire Chevalier","Benjamin Guyonnet","Jérôme Jourde","Nicolas Lavesque","Paulo Bonifácio","James A Blake"],"categories":["Ecology","Coast"],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"72e89c751bfe1ae7e6c1b086577b3af1","permalink":"https://bonif.io/publication/2017/le-garrec-2017-uk/","publishdate":"2020-04-28T20:20:57.941647Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017/le-garrec-2017-uk/","section":"publication","summary":"The cirratulid species _Chaetozone corona_ is reported for the first time from the North-east Atlantic waters.
